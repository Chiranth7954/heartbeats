# heartbeats music
Our group came together this weekend to create a program that would assist users in optimizing their workout experiences, based on beats/minute and their individual preferences.
We built a front-end primarily in HTML5, and an authorization field via OAuth (Spotipy). Server-side we used two APIs, Google Fit and Spotify, to pull from a pool of big data to create our own database using MongoDB. MongoDB was essential to our program, and gave us future potential to serve individual clients based on their own needs and requests.
